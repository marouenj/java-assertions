# java-assertions
A tutorial on programmatically enabling assertions in Java

It is common and a requirement to validate variables when coding; Checking that a variable is null is common to see as the first line inside a method. However if your code is 'well tested' and you know a particular variable state (null for example) will never be achieved, then you're having a useless condition statement.

Assertions solve this by giving the choice to enable or not validations. A good practice is to enable them during development and testing only.

This little tutorial shows how to programmatically bootstrap an 'main' instance with assertions enabled.
